# Outreach Committee Member
As a member of the Association of Computer Engineers (ACE) at the University of Florida, I became a memeber of the Outreach Committee from August to December 2016.  As part of this committee I collaborated with other members to start new outreach events that ACE members could volunteer for.  Part of my responsibilities also included connecting with local organizations and companies to hold workshops for children.  As a member of ACE and the ACE committee I volunteered at these workshops and other events to introduce children to the STEM field.

# Involvement and Fundraising Chair
As the Involvement and Fundraising Chair for Gator Powerlifting I introduced and discussed new ideas for supporting the team atmosphere and fundraising for team events.
