# GE Aviation, Systems division (Smiths Aerospace)

From May 2018 to August 2018 I was a Mission Systems intern at GE Aviation in Grand Rapids, Michigan.  As an intern I worked multiple projects for two different teams, the Mission Systems team and Processes and Tools team.  I worked on multiple projects for both of these teams throughout the Summer.
